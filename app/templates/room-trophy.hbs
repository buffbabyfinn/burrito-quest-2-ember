He turns towards you, and screams "I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD! I WATCHED YOU DIE." You're blocking the door, he has nowhere to run this time. Randy quickly picks up the phone and dials security. "HELP! THERE'S A WOMAN IN HERE TRYING TO KILL-" you cut him off with a swift blow to the head with your beloved kegstand trophy! You're standing over Randy's unconscious body.</p>
