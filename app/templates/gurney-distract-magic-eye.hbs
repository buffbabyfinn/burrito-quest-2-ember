<p>The security guard is all like "Oh damn I love Magic Eye books! Let me flip through this instead of making sure that you're not trying to smuggle one of our doctors out of this hospital in some half-assed Weekend at Bernie's-style scheme." Wow that was easy.</p>
<p>You wheel Randy all the way back to your place, about 5 miles, mostly uphill. You chain Randy's unconscious body to the fridge. While you wait for Randy to come to, you begin to arrange all sorts of burrito ingredients out in front of him. When Randy finally comes to, he begins to look around and eventually focuses in on you. "Randy, it is time for you to pay for wronging me. You will now construct a most delicious burrito for me." Randy replies "Wanda, how did I ever wrong you?". "Randy, do you remember March 23rd, 2012? It was on that day, that you threw away my burrito." "Wanda, that was a crusty, half-eaten burrito, and it had been in the fridge for 2 weeks. It was covered in mold." "I DON'T CARE IF IT HAD A MOLD HAT. YOU RUINED MY LIFE." "Wanda, you need to let it go." "Right after you fix this..." "I only lived with you for two weeks, I don't even know you." "Well, I certainly know YOU. Inside and out." "Oh really? Prove it."</p>
