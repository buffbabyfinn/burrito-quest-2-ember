"Hey kid, I'll give you $14 for your slingshot. That money could probably go towards your cancer treatment!" "First of all, I am 57 years old. Second, I don't have cancer, I just have male pattern baldness. I was going to give this as a present to my nephew, but I could sure use the money. I'm gonna net $4 out of this transaction! Here you go, have the slingshot! Take good care of it." You respond "Oh, I WILL."
